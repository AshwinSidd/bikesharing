# Bikesharing - Proposal

## Overview
To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, create a story using Tableau analyzing and vizualizing to - 
1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results 
1. *Checkout times of bike users* - It was established that it takes just 10 minutes for most bikes to be checked out in NYC. Around 150,000 rides are under 5 mins and around 35K within 24 mins.

## Summary
The analysis shows that NYC has many subscribers for bikeshare who are the main users generating more rides. As most bikes are used during office hours, it would be a good idea to market this bike share to working professionals who may find it easier/healthier/sustainable and environment friendly to use. The downtown and midtown areas seem to be popular with bike many end points and starting points here, hence at Des Moines, we could look at having more stalls at core areas. Also, taking into the account the number of trips taken for each bike, it gives a fair idea into the monthly expenses for maintenace of the bikes. 

However, more analysis can be explored in the future. New York City is one of the busiest and populated areas in the USA and using just the data for NYC may not give a good comparitive analysis. Hence we can look into diving into analysis of a larger set of data taking into account more cities in US, especially with population close to that of Des Moines. 

Also the data is only for 1 month of August, which may not give the full picture even though it is the most lucrative business month. As per the website www.bestplaces.net, Des Moines averages 204 sunny days per year. The US average is 205 sunny days. New York, New York gets 46.6 inches of rain, on average, per year. Des Moines, Iowa gets 35.9 inches of rain, on average, per year. (https://www.bestplaces.net/climate/?c1=51921000&c2=53651000#:~:text=Des%20Moines%20averages%20204%20sunny,%2C%20on%20average%2C%20per%20year.) So keeping this in mind, maybe few more months of data can be compared across NYC.
